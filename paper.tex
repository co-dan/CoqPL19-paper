\begin{abstract}
  Shallow and deep embeddings of DSLs have their pros and cons. For example,
  shallow embedding is excellent for quick prototyping, as it allows
  quick extension or modification of the embedded language.  Meanwhile, deep
  embedding is better suited for code transformation and compilation.
  Thus, it might be useful to be able to switch from shallow to deep
  embedding while making sure the semantics of the embedded language are
  preserved. We will demonstrate a working approach for implementing
  and proving such conversion using TemplateCoq.

\section{Introduction}

In the course of our work on the HELIX system \cite{helixFHPC18}, we faced
the problem of writing a certified compiler for a domain specific
language called $\Sigma$-HCOL, which is shallow-embedded in the Gallina
language of Coq proof assistant \cite{Coq}. The approach presented in
this report is the result of a summer of 2018 collaborative visit to INRIA,
where the use of TemplateCoq \cite{anand2018towards} was first suggested by
Matthieu Sozeau and successfully implemented and used in the HELIX
project.

An application of this technique to reify $\Sigma$-HCOL can be found
in the HELIX source code. For illustrative purposes in this paper, we use a simpler language of arithmetic expressions on natural
numbers. It is shallow-embedded in Gallina and includes constants,
bound variables, and three arithmetic operators: $+$, $-$, and
$*$, the complete source for which can be found in the git repository
\url{https://github.com/vzaliva/CoqPL19-paper}.

\subsection{Example}

Provided that $a, b, c, x \in \N$, the expression below is an example of a valid
expression in the source language:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize,
  caption=Expression in source language,
  label=lst:sexp]
            2 + a*x*x + b*x + c.
\end{lstlisting}

The target language includes the same operators but will be defined by
an inductive type of its AST:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  caption=Target language type,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
Inductive NExpr: Type :=
| NVar  : nat -> NExpr (* using Bruijn indices *)
| NConst: nat -> NExpr
| NPlus : NExpr -> NExpr -> NExpr
| NMinus: NExpr -> NExpr -> NExpr
| NMult : NExpr -> NExpr -> NExpr.
\end{lstlisting}

The expression from Listing~\ref{lst:sexp}, translated to the target
language, looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize,
  caption=Expression in target language, label=lst:texp]
NPlus (NPlus (NPlus (NConst 2)
  (NMult (NMult (NVar 3) (NVar 0)) (NVar 0)))
    (NMult (NVar 2) (NVar 0))) (NVar 1)
\end{lstlisting}

The purpose of the reification step is just to switch from shallow to
deep embedding. Thus, the target language syntax is supposed to be
close to the source language syntax. We just change the representation and
enforce the scope of the shallow embedding to ensure that only the
allowed subset of Gallina is used. This makes translation implementation fairly
straightforward. Additionally, this allows automatic proof of semantic
preservation as shown below.

\section{Translation}

The translation process performs reification of a given expression,
producing a translated expression in the target language. It is implemented as a
\textit{template program} named \emph{reifyNExp}.

The input expressions are presented in a closed form, where all
variables first need to be introduced via lambda bindings. Thus, the
input expression could be either just $\N$ in the simplest case or
n-ary function of natural numbers, for example $\N -> \N -> \N$. For
our reification program to be able to accept all expressions with
varying arity, the \textit{universe polymorphism}
feature \cite{sozeau2014universe} is used to type the input.

In addition to the input expression, \emph{reifyNExp} takes two names
(as strings). The first is used as the name of a new
definition, to which the expression in the target language will be
bound. The second is the name to which the semantic preservation lemma will be bound, as
discussed in the next section.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize, caption=Reification program]
Polymorphic Definition reifyNExp@{t u}
  {A:Type@{t}}} (res_name lemma_name: string) (nexpr:A)
  : TemplateMonad@{t u} unit.
\end{lstlisting}

When executed, if successful, \emph{reifyNExp} will create a new
definition and new lemma with given names. If not, it will fail with an
error. The reason for a failure might that the expression contains
constructs which are legal in Gallina but not part of our embedded
language. The translation is implemented in a straightforward way,
traversing the Gallina AST of the original expression.

\section{Semantics Preservation}

The semantics of our source language are defined by Gallina. On the
other hand, the inductive type representing the target language needs
to be given semantics. We do this by providing an
evaluation function. It takes an \textit{evaluation context} which
holds the current values of free variables, the expression being
evaluated, and returns the results as a natural
number or \emph{None} in case of error.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
Definition evalContext:Type := list nat.
Fixpoint evalNexp ($\Gamma$:evalContext) (e:NExpr): option nat.
\end{lstlisting}

The evaluation may fail, for example, if the expression references a
variable not present in the evaluation context. As variables are
represented by their indices in $\Gamma$, this will happen if an index is greater
or equal to the length of $\Gamma$.

The semantic preservation is expressed as a heterogeneous relation
between expressions in source and target languages:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
Definition NExpr_term_equiv ($\Gamma$: evalContext)
  (d: NExpr) (s: nat) : Prop := evalNexp $\Gamma$ d = Some s.
\end{lstlisting}

Consequently, the lemma generated by \emph{reifyNExp} for our example in Listing~\ref{lst:sexp} 
will state semantic equivalence between its expression and that of Listing~\ref{lst:texp}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
forall x c b a : nat, NExpr_term_equiv [x; c; b; a]
    NPlus (NPlus (NPlus (NConst 2)
        (NMult (NMult (NVar 3) (NVar 0)) (NVar 0)))
        (NMult (NVar 2) (NVar 0))) (NVar 1)
    (2 + a * x * x + b * x + c)
\end{lstlisting}

The generated lemma still needs to be proven. Because the expressions
in the original and target languages have the same structure, such proof
can be automated. The general idea is to define and prove semantic
equivalence lemmas for each pair of operators and then add them as
hints into a hint database used with the \emph{eauto} tactic:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
Lemma NExpr_add_equiv ($\Gamma$: evalContext) {a b a' b' }:
  NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ a a' -> NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ b b' ->
  NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ (NPlus a b) (Nat.add a' b').

Lemma NExpr_mul_equiv ($\Gamma$: evalContext) {a b a' b' }:
  NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ a a' -> NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ b b' ->
  NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ (NMult a b) (Nat.mul a' b').

Lemma NExpr_const_equiv ($\Gamma$: evalContext) {v v' }:
  evalNexp $\Gamma$ (NConst v) = Some v' ->
  NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ (NConst v) v'.

Lemma NExpr_var_equiv ($\Gamma$: evalContext) {v x}:
  evalNexp $\Gamma$ (NVar v) = Some x ->
  NExpr_term_equiv $\Gamma$ (NVar v) x.

Create HintDb NExprHints.
Hint Resolve NExpr_add_equiv NExpr_mul_equiv: NExprHints.
Hint Resolve NExpr_const_equiv NExpr_var_equiv: NExprHints.

Obligation Tactic := intros; simpl; eauto 99 with NExprHints.
Run TemplateProgram (reifyNExp "Ex1_def" "Ex1_lemma" Ex1).
\end{lstlisting}

The ASTs of the original and translated expressions and the semantic
equivalence relations between them are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:trees}.

\section{Summary}

Our approach could be summarized as follows. In order to translate a
language shallowly embedded in Gallina into a deep embedding, complete
the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Define an inductive type for the target language AST.
\item Implement an evaluation function for the target language.
\item Define a semantic equivalence relation between expressions in
  source and target languages.
\item Implement reification as a template program which generates an
  expression in the target language and a semantic preservation lemma.
\item Define and prove lemmas of semantic equivalence between
  operators of source and target languages.
\item Define per-operator semantic equivalence lemmas and add them to the
  hints database.
\item Use \emph{eauto} to prove automatically generated semantic
  preservation lemma.  
\end{enumerate}

We successfully applied this approach to non-trivial $\Sigma$-HCOL language in
HELIX, featuring binders, dependent types, and high-order operators. We
found it easy to implement and recommend using it as a guide for
switching from shallow to deep embedding of DSLs.
